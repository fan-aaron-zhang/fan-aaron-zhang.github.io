### About

BVI-SR contains 24 unique video sequences at a range of spatial resolutions up to UHD-1 (3840p). These sequences were used as the basis for a large-scale subjective experiment exploring the relationship between visual quality and spatial resolution when using three distinct spatial adaptation filters (including a CNN-based super-resolution method). The results demonstrate that while spatial resolution has a significant impact on mean opinion scores (MOS), no significant reduction in visual quality between UHD-1 and HD resolutions for the superresolution method is reported. A selection of image quality metrics were benchmarked on the subjective evaluations, and analysis indicates that VIF offers the best performance.
