Title: 
BVI-DVC: A Training Database for Deep Video Compression

This .zip file contains 800 sequences within the BVI-DVC training database. These are selected from
1) Videvo Free Stock Video Footage set (Stock footage provided by Videvo, downloaded from https://www.videvo.net)
2) IRIS32 Free 4K Footage set (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJee-JAzoRRH5T0wqe7_tw)
3) Harmonics database (https://www.harmonicinc.com/)
4) BVI-Texture database (https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/1if54ya4xpph81fbo1gkpk5kk4)

9) Mitch Martinez Free 4K Stock Footage set (https://mitchmartinez.com/free-4k-red-epic-stock-footage/)
10) Dareful Free 4K Stock Video data set (https://www.dareful.com/)
11) MCL-V database (http://mcl.usc.edu/mcl-v-database/)
12) MCL-JCV database (http://mcl.usc.edu/mcl-jcv-dataset/)
13) Netflix Chimera (https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80015538)
14) TUM HD databases (https://www.ei.tum.de/en/ldv/research/videolab/data-sets-downloads/tum-1080p50-data-set/)
15) Ultra Video Group-Tampere University database (http://ultravideo.cs.tut.fi/#testsequences)

All of these were truncated from their original length to 64 frames without any scene cuts. The sequences in this database was carefully selected to cover a wide range of video scenes and texture types that will be beneficial to improvement of generalisation ability of CNN models.

How to use BVI-DVC database?

1. Before using the database, all .mp4 files must be decompressed as 4:2:0 YCbCr files. You can:
		1) Unzip the BVI-DVC.zip file.
		2) Download ffmpeg software from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html, and place the "ffmpeg-hi10-heaac.exe" file alongside the "decompress.m" file.
		3) Using MATLAB to run the "decompress.m" file.

2. The 800 videos can be used to train CNN models for deep video compression or other computer video tasks, such as image/video super-resolution, image/video enhancement, video frame interpolation, etc..

If there is any issue with the use of the database, please send emails to: fan.zhang@bristol.ac.uk
